# arewesmallyet
Code and data for a website to track Firefox executable bloat.

Demo available at http://camjn.github.io/arewesmallyet/

TODO:
- when zooming the graph the releases always get wiped out except the latest one, should show correct releases for time period shown (involves flot.selection I think).
- separate mac & mac_64
- re-scrape all days that lack a version
